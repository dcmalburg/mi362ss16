<h1>Best Songs of All Time </h1>

<p class=>In the words of Ludwig van Beethoven, "Music is ... A higher revelation than all Wisdom & Philosophy". Music is the soundtrack of life, and just as everyone's story is different, so is their taste for a soundtrack. The list for the Top 25 songs of all time took a little while longer to compile because of the variety of songs on the lists. The first list I used was Rolling Stone's "500 Best Songs of All Time". Jay-Z constructed this list and used the amount of weeks spent at the top of the Billboard charts. The second list used Telegraph.com's "100 Best Songs List". This list seems to be built on the opinion of the writer, however, there is much overlap from many other "top songs" lists. </p>
